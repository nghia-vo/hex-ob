"""
HEX beamline Kinetix detector device definitions (ophyd-async).

Devices defined here:
    - kinetix1  : Kinetix camera #1  (XF:27ID1-BI{Kinetix-Det:1})
    - kinetix3  : Kinetix camera #3  (XF:27ID1-BI{Kinetix-Det:3})

Written against ophyd-async 0.19.x — the version pinned by
hex-profile-collection (``pixi.toml``: ``ophyd-async = ">=0.19.3,<0.20"``).
In 0.19 a detector is assembled from building blocks:

    KinetixDetector(prefix, *writer_factories)

The ``ADWriterFactory`` supplies the file-writer plugin IO (``NDFileHDF5IO``
on ``HDF1:``) and a "data logic" that decides how frames are captured and
described.  The ``PathProvider`` that decides *where* files land is captured
inside the data-logic factory — there is no ``set_path_provider()`` on the
detector, so plans that let the scientist choose an output directory use the
``SettablePathProvider`` below (see ``plans/tomography/alignment_scan.py``).

HEX specifics (same workarounds as hex-profile-collection
``startup/10-kinetix.py``):
    - SWMR mode is disabled (not supported at HEX).
    - The HDF flush-now signal is not used (it can lock the HDF plugin).
    - File close waits up to 60 s (closing on network storage routinely
      exceeds the default 10 s timeout).
    - After every scan (or abort) the camera is returned to
      Continuous / Internal mode so the live-view image stream restarts.
